# Data Commons Companion Skill — Base Guidance

Universal guidance for querying federal and international statistical data through the Google Data Commons MCP server.

## Purpose and when to use

Data Commons is a unified knowledge graph of aggregated statistics from authoritative sources: U.S. Census Bureau (ACS, Decennial), BLS, CDC, Department of Education, EPA, and many international statistical agencies. Use it for demographic, labor, health, education, and environment indicators — anything that answers "how many people / what share / what rate" for a place and a time.

- **Use Data Commons when** the question needs an ACS / Decennial / BLS / CDC / NCES / EPA figure with an auditable source and vintage.
- **Use Socrata when** the question is about city operational data (311, permits, crime, inspections, licenses, payroll, violations) or data that changes daily.
- **Use both when** equity questions need operational data joined against demographic context. See *Cross-source decision logic* below.

## Two-tool workflow

Data Commons exposes two tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| search_indicators | Discover the variable DCID matching a natural-language request for a place |
| get_observations | Retrieve actual values for a variable DCID at a place DCID (with an optional date range) |

**The default workflow is two-step: search first, then fetch.** Do not skip search_indicators. Data Commons has hundreds of thousands of statistical variables with precise, non-obvious names, and guessing a DCID burns tool calls on empty responses.

### Worked example

User: *"What was the median household income for Manhattan?"*

1. Call search_indicators with "median household income" and place DCID geoId/36061 (NY County = Manhattan). The response includes candidate variable DCIDs — typically Median_Income_Household and close relatives.
2. Call get_observations with that variable DCID and place DCID. The response is observations from ACS 5-Year Estimates.
3. Report the figure with source (ACS 5-Year Estimates) and vintage (e.g., 2020-2024).

Echo the DCID you picked back to the user so variable-selection mistakes get caught before they propagate.

## DCID patterns

Every place and every statistical variable in Data Commons has a **DCID** (Data Commons identifier). Two families matter most.

### Place DCIDs

| Pattern | Example | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| country/USA | country/USA | Country |
| geoId/XX | geoId/36 | US state (2-digit FIPS — 36 = New York) |
| geoId/XXXXX | geoId/36061 | US county (5-digit FIPS — 36061 = NY County / Manhattan) |
| geoId/XXXXXXX | geoId/3651000 | US city or incorporated place (7-digit FIPS — 3651000 = New York City) |
| geoId/<11-digit FIPS> | geoId/36061010100 | US census tract |
| geoId/<12-digit FIPS> | geoId/360610101001 | US census block group |
| zip/XXXXX | zip/10001 | ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) |

Place hierarchies nest: block group → tract → county → state → country. Always pass the most specific DCID the question permits, and verify with the user whether "Manhattan" means the county (geoId/36061), the borough neighborhood, or a narrower slice before committing.

### Variable DCIDs

Variable DCIDs are mixed-case, loosely snake-case-ish, and often long and descriptive:

- Count_Person — total population
- Median_Income_Household — median household income
- Count_Person_BelowPovertyLevelInThePast12Months — persons below poverty (ACS count)
- Percent_Person_BelowPovertyLevelInThePast12Months — same, as a percent

Never invent a variable DCID from pattern-matching against similar-looking ones. Always discover it with search_indicators.

## Small-area coverage and limitations

Data Commons natively supports **US census tract**, **US census block group**, **ZCTA** (zip/XXXXX), county, state, and country place types.

Data Commons does **NOT** natively support NYC community districts, city council districts, Neighborhood Tabulation Areas, Chicago community areas, or arbitrary municipal boundaries beyond incorporated-place FIPS codes.

For civic analyses that need community-district or council-district resolution, the current pattern is to **work at the census tract level** and state the geography choice explicitly in the output. A tract-to-admin-geography crosswalk utility is planned as follow-up work and tracked separately; do not emulate it by guessing tract memberships.

## Aggregation semantics — silent wrong answers

**This is the single biggest risk of Data Commons queries.** Unlike a SoQL error that returns 0 rows or a 400 status, a wrong Data Commons query returns a plausible-looking but incorrect number. No exception, no warning, no hint that the variable, time range, or place type was off.

To prevent silent wrong answers:

1. **Verify the variable matches intent.** If the user asks for "poverty rate," return the percent variable (Percent_Person_BelowPovertyLevelInThePast12Months), not the raw count. When search_indicators returns multiple candidates, echo the top 2-3 and narrate your choice.
2. **Confirm the place type.** A "Manhattan" answer at county resolution is a different number than at block-group resolution. State which place type you queried: *"I queried at the county level (NY County, geoId/36061)."*
3. **Surface the vintage.** ACS releases annually; "2023" could be ACS 1-Year 2023 or ACS 5-Year 2019-2023 depending on availability. Put the vintage inline with the value, not in a footnote.
4. **Cite the source provider.** Every observation includes provenance — dataset, statistical agency, release. Surface these alongside the number. A figure without its source is not a Data Commons answer.
5. **Flag ambiguity.** If search_indicators returns several plausible variables and you cannot confidently narrow, stop and ask the user to clarify before returning a number.

## Cross-source decision logic

When a question touches both demographic data (Data Commons) and civic operational data (Socrata), plan the work before making tool calls:

1. **Split the question.** Which part is demographic, which is operational?
2. **Fetch operational data from Socrata** at the most specific geography it supports.
3. **Fetch demographic data from Data Commons** at census tract, or the nearest supported geography.
4. **Join on tract DCID**, not on mismatched place types. If a question cannot be answered at tract resolution (e.g., "by community district"), explain the geography gap rather than joining across mismatched units.
5. **Attribute each number to its source in the output.** The reader should see at a glance which figures came from Socrata and which from Data Commons.

If a question is genuinely ambiguous — "how many New Yorkers earn under $50k?" could be ACS or NYC payroll — ask one brief clarifying question before querying.

## Attribution and provenance

Attribute every Data Commons observation with the **source dataset** (e.g., "ACS 5-Year Estimates, 2020-2024"), the **statistical agency** (e.g., "U.S. Census Bureau"), and the **place DCID** and **variable DCID** used, so the answer is reproducible.

When a Data Commons call is part of an analysis published as a record package${getPublicationHost() ? ` on ${getPublicationHost()}` : ''}, the provenance graph captures the DCIDs, variable, vintage, and place type automatically. It emits Data Commons as a distinct prov:Agent alongside Socrata agents so a reader verifying the package can tell exactly which numbers came from which source.

## Empty or unrelated results

If search_indicators returns empty or obviously irrelevant variables, it usually means one of:

1. The variable exists but is suppressed at that resolution (ACS small-area non-publication)
2. The place DCID is wrong — re-check the FIPS pattern
3. The question cannot be answered from Data Commons and needs a different source (Socrata, a direct API, or web search)

Do not fabricate a value. Report the empty result, state the DCID and query you tried, and suggest a narrower geography or an alternative source.
