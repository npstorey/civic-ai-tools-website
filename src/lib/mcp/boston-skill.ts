# Boston OpenContext Companion Skill — Base Guidance

Guidance for querying Boston civic open data through the OpenContext MCP server at data-mcp.boston.gov/mcp. OpenContext is a CKAN-native MCP framework maintained by the City of Boston; it fronts the CKAN DataStore powering Analyze Boston (data.boston.gov).

## Purpose and when to use

- **Use Boston OpenContext** for Boston civic data on data.boston.gov — 311 requests, permits, crime, inspections, property records, elections, schools, parcels, parking, neighborhoods.
- **Use Socrata** for other cities (NYC, Chicago, SF, Seattle, LA). Boston is not on Socrata.
- **Use Data Commons for Boston demographics** — ACS / Census / BLS figures for Boston, Suffolk County (geoId/25025), Boston city (geoId/2507000), or tracts. Don't go hunting for demographic tables on Analyze Boston.

When a question mixes operational and demographic data ("311 noise per capita by neighborhood"), plan a multi-source analysis: operational counts from OpenContext, population denominator from Data Commons at tract level. State the geography caveat — neighborhoods and council districts are not standard census geographies.

## CKAN vs Socrata — the one-screen summary

Boston runs CKAN, not Socrata:

| Concern | Socrata | CKAN / OpenContext |
|---------|---------|--------------------|
| Query language | SoQL (SQL-like but dialectal) | PostgreSQL SELECT |
| Dataset identity | 4x4 code (erm2-nwe9) | UUID resource id (8048697b-ad64-4bfc-b090-ee00169f2323) |
| Identifier quoting in SQL | not required | UUIDs MUST be double-quoted: FROM "uuid-here" |
| Schema discovery | get_data with LIMIT 1 | ckan__get_schema (explicit) |
| Aggregation | SELECT ... GROUP BY via get_data | ckan__aggregate_data or ckan__execute_sql |
| Writes | Not exposed | Blocked server-side — only SELECT passes |

## Typical workflow chain

1. **ckan__search_datasets** — natural-language discovery. Returns candidate datasets with their UUID resource ids.
2. **ckan__get_dataset** — inspect a dataset's full metadata; pick the right resource when a dataset bundles several.
3. **ckan__get_schema** — fetch field names/types. Run this before querying unfamiliar data — Boston uses CKAN field conventions, not the NYC/Chicago conventions a model may have memorized.
4. **ckan__query_data** — simple equality-filter queries. Good for "rows where field = value" patterns.
5. **ckan__aggregate_data** — structured GROUP BY + metrics. Prefer this over raw SQL for countable/summable questions; the server compiles safe SQL from a JSON spec (group_by, metrics, filters, having, order_by).
6. **ckan__execute_sql** — raw SELECT for CTEs, window functions, JOINs, percentile aggregates.

Don't skip steps 1-3 on an unfamiliar dataset — guessing a field name against a 500-column CKAN resource silently returns zero rows or a SQL error.

## Boston-specific geographies

- **Neighborhoods** — not Census tracts. ~20 city-maintained names (Dorchester, Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, South Boston, ...).
- **BPD districts** — 12 police districts (A1, A7, B2, B3, C6, C11, D4, D14, E5, E13, E18). Different from neighborhoods.
- **BPS school zones** — Boston Public Schools has its own geography; present on school datasets only.
- **Parcel IDs** — 10-digit strings. Assessor data is keyed on parcel, not address; to go address to parcel, query the parcels dataset first.
- **ZIP codes** — 021xx range. Boston crosses multiple ZIPs; treat carefully when comparing against ACS ZCTAs.

Neighborhoods do NOT map cleanly to Census tracts. When joining Boston operational data with Data Commons tract-level demographics, state the geography mismatch rather than silently imputing.

## Caveats

- **Update cadence varies.** 311 daily, assessor annually, crime weekly. Surface metadata_updated or last_modified when the question is time-sensitive.
- **Coverage gaps.** Some city agencies (BPD, BPS, BPL) publish partial data. If a natural query returns empty, the data genuinely may not be there — say so rather than fishing.
- **Resource UUIDs change** when a dataset gets a v2 resource. Re-run search/get_dataset for current IDs each session; don't cache UUIDs across runs.
- **Hot-spotting risk.** Crime and 311 point-level data can be re-identifying when filtered narrowly. Honor aggregation thresholds — don't report a single address.

## Attribution

Cite Boston OpenContext analyses with: dataset title, resource UUID, data.boston.gov portal URL, and the SQL / aggregation spec that produced the number. The record-package layer captures tool calls and args automatically; your job in the text output is to make the citation human-readable.
